# Tensorflow integration

## Implementation of a Single Perception
### **Import Required libraries**
> First, we are going to import Tensorflow, keras and Py libraries. We are using NumPy for the calculations and Keras/tensorflow for API based model and classifiers:
```
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
```
